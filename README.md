### Summary of the Project and the Problem It Was Solving

The projectâ€™s purpose was to create an application for Airgead Banking that calculates and displays the growth of an initial investment over a number of years, both with and without additional monthly deposits. The primary problem it solved was helping users to see how their investments could grow over time with compounding interest, making it easier to plan for their financial future and make informed decisions.

### What Did I Do Particularly Well?

I believe I did particularly well in structuring the code to be modular and readable. By organizing the code into clear classes and methods, the code became easier to understand, maintain, and add new features. I also made sure to implement user input validation to handle different scenarios, making sure the application can handle any incorrect inputs.

### Where Could I Enhance My Code?

One area for enhancement is optimizing calculation process to improve performance, particularly when dealing with larger input values. By using more efficient algorithms, we can cut down on computation time. It's also important to incorporate secure coding practices, like thoroughly validating all inputs, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

### Most Challenging Pieces of Code

The most challenging part was ensuring the calculations for both scenarios (with and without monthly deposits) were accurate and displayed correctly. I overcame this by carefully debugging the logic, using various test cases to ensure correctness. I also found resources like textbooks, articles and forums helpful for understanding complex C++ features.

### Transferable Skills

From this project, the skills that are particularly transferable include user input validation to ensure proper handling of user inputs and employing mathematical and financial concepts such as calculating yearly compounding interest.

### Making the Program Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable

To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I used consistent formatting like consistently using indentation and spacing to enhance readability. When naming, I used meaningful variable and method names that convey their purpose. I added comments throughout the code to explain complex concepts. Lastly, I organized the code into functions and classes in order to separate different aspects and make it easier to add improvements in the future.
